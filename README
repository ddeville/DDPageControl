An easily customizable alternative to UIKit's UIPageControl

DDPageControl redefines exactly every property and methods available in UIPageControl.
Using DDPageControl without customization will actually lead exactly to a UIPageControl.

However, the power of DDPageControl is that you can set some additional properties that will affect the way the look and feel of the page controls.

There are two color properties: one for 'on' controls and one for 'off' controls. You are free to pass an alpha channel for any of these colors'

You can also set the type of indicators you want as a filled circle or a simple ellipse.

Also you can use an image for 'on' or/and 'off' state.

Finally, the diameter of every indicator and their spacing is also customizable by setting a couple of properties.
